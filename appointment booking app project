Architecture Overview

High-Level Flow:

[ Mobile-Friendly Web / Hybrid App ]
            |
            v
[ Backend API (Java + Spring Boot) ]
            |
            v
[ Database (PostgreSQL / MySQL) ]
            |
            v
[ Email (SMTP/JavaMail) ]  [ SMS (Twilio) ]  [ Payments (Stripe/PayPal) ]


Design Principles:

Decoupled frontend & backend → easy upgrades

Use mature, stable tech → avoid breaking changes

Minimal dependencies → only essential modern libraries (payments, optional SMS)

Containerization → ensures consistent environment across deployments

Responsive design / hybrid wrapper → mobile-ready without multiple native apps

Development Strategy (One-Man Developer Friendly)

Week 1–2: Define MVP, features, and target niche

Week 3–4: Build backend (Java + Spring Boot + DB) + web frontend (responsive HTML/Bootstrap/jQuery)

Week 5: Integrate email reminders (JavaMail) + Stripe payments

Week 6: Test MVP with 5–10 local businesses

Week 7: Launch free trial + start simple marketing

Week 8+: Add hybrid mobile wrapper (Cordova) and optional features

Why This Stack Works for Long-Term Stability

All backend, database, and web technologies are proven, decades-old, enterprise-grade

Mobile-friendly without requiring frequent framework updates

Minimal modern dependencies → only payments & optional SMS

Easy to maintain as a solo developer

Scalable and modular for future features
